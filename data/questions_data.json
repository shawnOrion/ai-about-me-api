My goal is to make it super clear that anyone can create games or apps if they learn how to work with AI tools like Rosie.

I remember my first no-code tutorial for Flappy Bird, I thought it might be too technical. Then someone said, 'This is exactly what I needed to get started!' That really stuck with me.

For example, if you're tired of repeating the same prompts in Rosebud, you could create a tool that suggests prompts based on ones you've used before.

ChatGPT is flexible, allowing me to be super creative - like, I'd use it as a programming assistant at work, and then as an AI character to test my roleplay game for fun. Copilot is convenient for coding, but isn't flexible. Hard to use for brainstorming and creative collaboration during a project.
